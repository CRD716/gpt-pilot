# 🍻 Contributing
If you are interested in contributing to GPT Pilot, I would be more than happy to have you on board and also help you get started. Feel free to ping [zvonimir@pythagora.ai](mailto:zvonimir@pythagora.ai), and I'll help you get started.

## 🔬️ Research
Since this is a research project, there are many areas that need to be researched on both practical and theoretical levels. We're happy to hear how the entire GPT Pilot concept can be improved. For example, maybe it would work better if we structured functional requirements differently, or maybe technical requirements need to be specified in a different way.

## 🖥 Development
Other than the research, GPT Pilot needs to be debugged to work in different scenarios. For example, we realized that the quality of the code generated is very sensitive to the size of the development task. When the task is too broad, the code has too many bugs that are hard to fix, but when the development task is too narrow, GPT also seems to struggle in getting the task implemented into the existing code.
